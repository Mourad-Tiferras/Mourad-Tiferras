# 💫 WhoamI: 


<h3>
   
   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; I'm Mourad (just a simple person) with a great passion to all thing related to IT, and electronics from a very young age. I'm a drop-out CS (computer science) student after 2y and half <b> (due to the poor IT training with heavy cources not related to technology)</b>. Currently, I have just started self-learning in IT and trying harder while navigating through life.
   <br>
   <br>
   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Even that I decide after to continue my academic education, I don’t put much belief in degrees, because the solid skills I’ve gained through self-learning are more powerful and practical than what many acquire in a 4/3 years in a CS degree.<br> 
   <br> 
   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; I've chosen the path of self-learning to grow my skills in software development, with a strong focus on discovering vulnerabilities in code. I'm passionate about breaking the things developers build not only to destroy, but also to make them stronger by curiosity and love.
